# Topic 3 - Slinding Window

# üìò Theory
## Introduction to Sliding Window
The Sliding Window technique is a method for solving problems involving arrays or strings by maintaining a window that slides over the data structure to keep track of a subset of elements. It is particularly useful for problems that require finding subarrays or substrings that satisfy certain conditions.

### Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n)
- Worst Case: O(n)

### Space Complexity
- O(1)  for most sliding window implementations, as it typically uses a fixed amount of extra space.

## üîÑ Variations of Binary Search
- Dynamic Sliding Window: The size of the sliding window can change dynamically based on the problem requirements. This variation is useful for problems where the window size is not fixed but depends on conditions met during iteration.
- Fixed Sliding Window: The size of the sliding window is fixed and does not change during iteration. This is useful for problems where the window size is predefined and remains constant.

## üîç Tips and Tricks
- Use the sliding window technique to maintain a running total or count within a window.
- Adjust the window size dynamically if the problem constraints require it.
- Practice with problems involving sums, averages, or distinct elements within a subarray or substring.
