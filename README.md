# Study Plan
This study plan follows the structured topics and provided resources divided into several topics, each of which focuses on a specific algorithm or data structure. 🗂️⚙️
<br />

For each topic, you will find a combination of theoretical explanations, coding implementations, selected resources, and practical problems. 📝💻
<br />

You can review it at any time, whether you have experience with the topics or are new and want to start preparing. 🔄🔍
