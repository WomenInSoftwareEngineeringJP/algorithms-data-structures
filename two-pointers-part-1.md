# Topic 2 - Two Pointers
![Two Pointer Dark Mode](https://github.com/WomenInSoftwareEngineeringJP/algorithms-data-structures/assets/77953414/9dd71c19-aa31-4515-950c-2135972532bb)

# üìò Theory
## Introduction to Two Pointers
The Two Pointers technique involves using two pointers to iterate through the data structure, often from different ends, to solve various problems more efficiently. This technique is particularly useful for problems involving arrays and linked lists.

### Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n)
- Worst Case: O(n)

### Space Complexity
- O(1) for iterative approaches

## üîÑ Variations of Binary Search
- Fast and Slow Pointer: The fast and slow pointer technique, also known as the tortoise and hare algorithm, involves using two pointers moving at different speeds. This technique is useful for detecting cycles in linked lists, finding the middle of a linked list, and other problems where relative movement between pointers is key.
- Back-to-Back Pointers: Two pointers start at the same position and move based on certain conditions, often used in problems involving searching or modifying the sequence.

## üîç Tips and Tricks
- Use it when the problem involves a sorted array or requires processing elements from both ends towards the center.
- It reduces the need for nested loops, thus improving time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n)
- Common scenarios for two pointers are finding pairs in arrays, reversing arrays, and solving problems involving subarrays or substrings.
