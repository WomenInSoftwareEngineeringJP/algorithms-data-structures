![Binary Search Dark Mode](https://github.com/WomenInSoftwareEngineeringJP/algorithms-data-structures/assets/77953414/ce6c19e7-8324-4a0c-895f-478bf7978d1c)

# üìò Theory
## Introduction to Binary Search
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

### Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(1)
- Average Case: O(log n)
- Worst Case: O(log n)

### Space Complexity
- O(1) for the iterative version
- O(log n) for the recursive version due to call stack usage

### üîß Implementation
- Iterative Approach
- Recursive Approach

## üîÑ Variations of Binary Search
- Lower Bound Binary Search: Finds the first position where the target can be inserted without disrupting the order.
- Upper Bound Binary Search: Finds the position just after the last occurrence of the target.
